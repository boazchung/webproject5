<h3>Why is this one of the Best?</h3>
<p> If you grew up like I did, this one of the games that you grew up with. I grew up with an older brother so I always had a competitive side to myself.
 This game helped me bring out my competitive side. What makes this game the best is that it allows you to play a competitive game with some of your favorite
 nintendo character with up to 7 other people. So if you looking for a game that lets you competitive with your friends without breaking them like Mario Party 
 this is the game for you!</p>

<h3> Why is this one of the Best?</h3>
<p> I think we can all agree that Mario Kart is byfar one of the most nostalgic Nintendo games to date. Whether you played on the N64, DS, or the Wii. Everyone has played Mario Kart.
It definitely brought out the same competitive bone that Mario Party brings to friendships as in that it could possibly cause a fight especially if you get hit with a blue shell while
you're in first. This is different than the past Mario Kart games because it has updated items that will definitely frustrate your friends. </p>

<div class="pokken">
<h2>Pokken Tournament</h2>

<h3>Why is this one of the Best?</h3>
<p>You know what's better than one game that gives you nostalgia? Two nostalgic games put into one. If you didn't catch on, Pokken Tournament is a
hybrid of Pokemon and Tekken. So you ever wanted to play an experience of true pokemon fight the same way they portray it in the show, you should buy Pokken Tournament.
This is byfar one of my favorite switch games to date. You can finally play out a Pikachu vs Mewtwo without having to worry about Mewtwo completely destroying Pikachu in one hit.</p>
